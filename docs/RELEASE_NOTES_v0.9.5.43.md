# Sentinel v0.9.5.43

## Fix

Adds a THP source-shape digit explosion guard.

The guard detects a mixed screenshot source where late-scroll rows around ~160M THP are present, but neighbouring rows from the same source are misread as ~760M/~790M and incorrectly jump to the top after power sorting.

## Principles

- Source-local only.
- No reliance on screenshot order, upload order, or filename order as truth.
- OCR rank remains weak evidence.
- Rank-conflict evidence is required before the high cluster is blocked.
- Quarantine remains preferred over false operational truth.
