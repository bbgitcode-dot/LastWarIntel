# Sentinel v0.9.5.45

## Focus

Field-level power recovery for mobile OCR leading-digit explosions.

## Added

- Source-local leading-digit recovery for THP values such as `764,292,586 -> 164,292,586` when rank/source context supports the correction.
- Source-local leading-digit recovery for Alliance Power values such as `77,739,565,950 -> 17,739,565,950` when the row is not a valid top-3 leader and the recovered value fits the local ranking envelope.
- Recovery metadata on corrected rows:
  - `power_original`
  - `power_recovered_from`
  - `power_recovery_method`
  - `power_sanity_status=recovered`

## Changed

- Ranking Power Sanity Guard no longer only quarantines this specific recoverable OCR class.
- Values are recovered only when intrinsic rank/source evidence is strong enough.
- The guard still quarantines suspicious values when no safe recovery candidate exists.

## Why

Server 553 proved that the v0.9.5.44 guard correctly identified false 7xx-M THP and 77B Alliance Power values, but it preserved them only in quarantine. The screenshots show that many of these values are recoverable leading-digit OCR errors rather than unusable rows.

Sentinel should not invent truth. But when the source-local evidence supports a deterministic field-level recovery, preserving the row with explicit recovery metadata is better than dropping useful data into review.
