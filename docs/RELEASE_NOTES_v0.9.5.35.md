# Sentinel v0.9.5.35 – THP Power Sanity Guard

## Focus

Protect Total Hero Power exports from OCR digit outliers that are locally inconsistent with their screenshot context.

## Fixed

- Prevents late-scroll THP OCR spikes such as `198M -> 798M` from being promoted to top ranks by the final power-order merge.
- Suspicious THP values are quarantined with explainable `thp_power_sanity` evidence instead of being silently imported.
- Keeps valid first-screen THP whales untouched; the guard only applies to later THP screenshots with local outlier evidence.

## Added

- `parser/thp_sanity_guard.py`
- THP local median outlier detection.
- Quarantine metadata:
  - `quarantine_reason = thp_power_sanity_outlier`
  - `ranking_guard_warning = thp_power_sanity:...`
  - `thp_sanity_local_median`
- Smoke tests for:
  - late-scroll THP outlier quarantine,
  - real first-screen whales allowed,
  - normal scroll overlap allowed.
