# Sentinel Project Status

**Current Version:** v0.9.5.49  
**Sprint Type:** Candidate Decision Engine Cutover  
**Runtime Baseline:** v0.9.5.49 – Candidate Decision Engine Cutover  
**Current Phase:** Data Integrity Fortress / Operational Data Stability  
**Next Planned Sprint:** v0.9.5.50 – Import Session and Segment Integrity

---

## Executive summary

Sentinel v0.9.5.49 completes the cutover from legacy leading-digit recovery to explicit candidate decisioning. The candidate generator and scorer remain in place, but the old fallback can no longer select a value when the context score is weak or tied.

This sprint deliberately favors precision over recall: clear candidate winners are recovered, while ambiguous ties are quarantined with audit metadata. The Server 553 regression class is now safer because near-zero score margins no longer become Operational Truth.

## What changed in v0.9.5.49

The remaining legacy leading-digit recovery decision fallback has been removed. Sentinel may still generate leading-digit candidates, but it no longer chooses a recovered value merely because a legacy rule can produce one.

The new decision path is:

```text
Candidate Generator
    ↓
Context Scoring
    ↓
Margin Decision Engine
    ↓
Recover only clear winners, quarantine ambiguous ties
```

This is intentionally stricter. Server 553 showed several cases where the selected legacy recovery was not the best scored candidate or where the margin was effectively zero. v0.9.5.49 now treats those cases as review-worthy uncertainty.

## What changed in v0.9.5.48

### Added

- Excel export columns for recovery audit fields:
  - `power_original`,
  - `power_recovered_from`,
  - `power_recovery_method`,
  - `power_recovery_status`,
  - `power_sanity_status`,
  - `power_sanity_confidence`,
  - `power_candidate_count`,
  - `power_candidate_best`,
  - `power_candidate_best_score`,
  - `power_candidate_second`,
  - `power_candidate_second_score`,
  - `power_candidate_margin`,
  - `power_recovery_selected_reason`,
  - `power_recovery_candidates`.
- Top-level `power_recovery` section in the import report.
- Per-row candidate traces in the import report.
- Per-import recovery counters.
- Regression coverage for Server 553-style reportability.

### Fixed

- Global `review_count` now aggregates import-level review counts instead of only counting concrete review objects.
- Candidate rows now carry direct best/second/margin fields, not only nested candidate metadata.

## Current known problems

### 1. Candidate scoring is explainable but still heuristic

**Status:** Improved, still needs operational validation  
**Observed on:** Server 553 regression class  
**Confidence:** High

Sentinel now exposes why a power candidate was selected or quarantined. The scoring engine is still heuristic and must continue to prefer quarantine when the best candidate is not clearly stronger than the second-best candidate.

### 2. Import session integrity remains open

**Status:** Open  
**Next Sprint:** v0.9.5.50

Sentinel still needs explicit import sessions and ranking segment metadata so mixed, missing, duplicate, and out-of-order screenshot sets can be detected without trusting filenames or upload order.

---

## Immediate next sprint recommendation: v0.9.5.50

### Focus

**Import Session and Segment Integrity**

### Expected outputs

- Explicit import session identifiers.
- Ranking segment metadata per source.
- Missing, duplicate, mixed, and out-of-order segment detection.
- Import report fields for segment continuity.
- Guardrails that continue to avoid filename/order/upload-order truth.

## Validation

```bash
python -m compileall -q parser services main.py version.py
pytest tests/smoke/test_ranking_power_sanity_guard.py tests/smoke/test_operational_import_repository.py tests/smoke/test_sentinel_ranking_guard.py tests/smoke/test_ranking_recovery.py -q
```

Observed result:

```text
23 passed
